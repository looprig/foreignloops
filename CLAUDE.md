# CLAUDE.md — Development Guidelines

## Design and dependency direction

Keep packages and types cohesive. Split code when responsibilities have different
owners, invariants, or reasons to change. Prefer composition for independent
capabilities and simple changes to existing types when behavior belongs there.

Every implementation of an interface must honor its complete contract. Keep
interfaces small and define them at the package that consumes them when a stable
boundary, substitution, or testing seam is needed. Depend on public contracts,
not concrete implementations; do not introduce an import from Harness back into
this module.

Prefer the standard library. External packages require explicit user approval.
The only approved external packages are:

- `github.com/looprig/core` — shared content and UUID values
- `github.com/looprig/harness` — public foreign, loop, command, event, and identity contracts
- `github.com/looprig/inference` v0.3.0 — direct test-only dependency for
  backend parity tests and provider fakes; not used by production packages
- `github.com/looprig/storage` — test-only transitive dependency of the compiling
  Harness rig composition example
- `golang.org/x/sys` — supported Darwin/Linux no-follow, open-relative, and
  advisory `flock` primitives for backend lock ownership
- `github.com/securego/gosec/v2` — security static analysis (development tool only)
- `golang.org/x/vuln/cmd/govulncheck` — Go vulnerability scanner (development tool only)
- `honnef.co/go/tools/cmd/staticcheck` — extended static analysis (development tool only)

The development module resolves the untagged Harness seam through the sibling
`../harness` checkout. A released `go.mod` must replace that local development
mapping with a tagged Harness version and must not contain a local `replace`.

## Validation and failures

Treat CLI arguments, environment variables, process output, transcript data, and
filesystem content as untrusted. Validate at the boundary before values enter
driver or backend logic. Reject unknown enum values, malformed records, missing
required fields, and unsafe paths.

Fail closed on error or ambiguity. Grant each component and child process only
the permissions, handles, paths, and environment values it needs. Never pass a
full configuration object where a narrow value or interface suffices.

Public failures that callers must classify, recover from, or inspect use typed or
sentinel errors and support `errors.Is` or `errors.As`. Wrap ordinary errors with
useful operation context; never discard errors or expose secrets in errors or
logs.

## Processes, environments, and paths

Invoke programs with `exec.CommandContext` and separate argument values. Never
build a shell command from external input. Every process operation must accept a
`context.Context`, honor cancellation and deadlines, close pipes, reap children,
and avoid goroutine or descriptor leaks.

Construct child environments from an explicit allowlist plus validated required
values. Do not inherit the parent environment wholesale, and do not forward
credentials unless the child contract explicitly requires them.

Process supervision supports macOS and Linux. Platform-specific implementations
must terminate the complete child process group on cancellation or failure.
Unsupported platforms must return a clear error before starting a child; they
must never fall back to weaker supervision.

Clean external paths with `filepath.Clean`, reject absolute paths where a relative
path is required, and verify that resolved paths remain beneath the intended
root. Defend against `..` traversal and symlink escape before opening or writing.

All I/O workflows accept a context and have a finite deadline or caller-provided
bound. Check cancellation around blocking file operations whose APIs do not take
a context. Do not start unbounded network, pipe, process, or filesystem work.

## Tests and secure builds

Build with `CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -trimpath ./...`. Keep the repository root free
of Go source files; packages live below it. All Go code must be `gofmt`-clean.

Run unit and integration tests with `-race`. Use focused tests for single
scenarios and table-driven tests for shared setup. Cover success, boundary,
invalid-input, cancellation, cleanup, and platform-failure paths. Code that
parses untrusted process or transcript data needs a fuzz target; run fuzzing with
an explicit bound such as `-fuzztime=30s`.

Commit `vendor/` and build, test, lint, and scan from it. `make vendor` refreshes
the tree, scrubs VCS metadata only from the declared local Harness replacement,
and rejects any remaining embedded `.git` metadata. Never broaden the scrub to
hide undeclared metadata.

Run `make secure` before each commit. It enforces the root-package boundary,
formatting, vendor integrity, `go vet`, staticcheck, gosec, module verification,
and govulncheck. Do not weaken or skip a failed check; diagnose the cause.
